		<p>We want you to find the best places to dance, grab drinks, and catch up with friends when you decide to go out.</p>

		<p>The places we go to have constantly changing atmospheres. The club you like to #DanceYourFaceOff might be #Crickets tonight. That bar that usually serves #WeakDrinks might have a new #GenerousBartender. Or perhaps you're looking for a place with #LustyIntentions or #EasyLikeSundayMorning. Let's find it.</p>

		<p>So use Kefi to find a place that matches your mood for tonight, then get out there and have a blast sharing your thoughts about it.</p>
		<br/>
		<p> That's why we called this app "Kefi"; it means "fun" in Hebrew and "the spirit of joy" in Greek.</p>

		<br/>
		<p>Bring the Kefi tonight,</p>
		<p>Gal and Paul.</p>
