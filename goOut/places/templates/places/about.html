		<p>We all love going out.</p>
		<p>And frankly, you deserve to find the best places to dance, grab drinks, and catch-up with friends.</p>

		<p>However, venues have different atmospheres that constantly change. But what if you knew what each bar and club were like right now? Looking for a place with #LustyIntentions, a place to #DanceYourFaceOff, or somewhere that's #EasyLikeSundayMorning? Let's find it.</p>

		<p>So get out there and have a blast tagging places to let our team know each place's vibe. Then, use Kefi to find your ideal scene.</p>
		<br/>
		<p> That's why we called this app "Kefi"; it means "fun" in Hebrew and "the spirit of joy" in Greek.</p>

		<br/>
		<p>Bring the Kefi tonight,</p>
		<p>Gal and Paul.</p>
